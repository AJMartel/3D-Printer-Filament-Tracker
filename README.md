Current Version: v1.0

# 3D Printer Filament Tracker

This is a small program I have been working on for the past couple weeks. It basically keeps track of your 3D printer filaments. It allows you to add/ edit filaments and prints.

## Update 1.1 (Coming Soon)
* Users can now create filament type, weight, and length. These will be saved to the save file and will be used to populate the combo boxes on the add filament dialog screen. **Copmplete**
* The save file will auto update to the correct format when using v1.1 **Complete**
* Auto check for updates **Complete**
